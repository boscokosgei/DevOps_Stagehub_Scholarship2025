 ## Understanding SDLC
  The Software Development Life Cycle provides the guidance required to create a software application. It does this by splitting these tasks into phases that form the Software Development Lifecycle. Standardising the tasks within each phase increases the efficiency of the development process. Each phase divides into granular tasks that can be measured and tracked. This introduces the capability of monitoring to ensure projects stay on track. The aim of SDLC is to establish repeatable processes and predictable outcomes from which future projects can benefit. SDLC phases are usually divided into 6-8 phases.

### Phases in SDLC
1. Planning: The planning phase encompasses all aspects of project and product management. This includes    resource allocation, project scheduling, cost estimation etc.
2. Requirements Definition: is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. For example, a social media application would require the ability to connect with a friend.
3. Design & Prototyping: establishing how the software application will work, programming language, methods to communicate with each other, architecture etc
4. Software Development: entails building the program, writing code and documentation.
5. Testing: In this phase, we ensure components work and can interact with each other. For example, each function works correctly, different parts of the application work seamlessly together, and performance-wise, there are no lags in processing etc. 
6. Deployment: in this stage, the application or project is made available to users.
7. Operations & Maintenance: this is where engineers respond to issues in the application or bugs and flaws reported by users and sometimes plan additional features in future releases.

## Difference Between Chown and Chmod in Linux
 In simple term chown is used to change the ownership of a file while chmod is for changing the file mode bits.
 - chown defines who owns the file.
 - chmod defines who can do what.

 ## Differences Between TCP and UDP
 Transmission control protocol (TCP) drives reliable data transfers. In contrast, user datagram protocol (UDP) prioritizes speed and efficiency, which are crucial to internet operations.
### TCP:- 
    The transmission control protocol (TCP) is defined as a connection-oriented communication protocol that allows computing devices and applications to send data via a network and verify its delivery, forming one of the crucial pillars of the global internet.

    The following are some of the most critical features of TCP:
    1. The client confirms data delivery from the server.
    2. After a timeout period, the server attempts retransmission for data that is not delivered.
    3. In a congested network, TCP delays data transmission.
    4. It uses a three-way handshake to check for data transmission errors.
### UDP:
    User datagram protocol (UDP) is a message-oriented communication protocol that allows computing devices and applications to send data via a network without verifying its delivery, which is best suited to real-time communication and broadcast systems.

    The UDP protocol is not suitable for sending electronic mail, viewing a web page, or downloading a file. However, it is preferred mainly for real-time applications like broadcasting or multitasking network traffic. 
    1. UDPâ€™s key features are as follows:
    2. It adapts to bandwidth-intensive applications that tolerate a loss of packets.
    3. There will be fewer delays in data transmission.
    4. It is used to send a large number of packets at a time.
    5. There is a possibility that you may lose some data
### Common Service Ports
   1. Http  - 80
   2. Https - 443
   3. FTP - 21
   4. SSH -22
   5. SFTP- 22
   6. Telenet - 23
